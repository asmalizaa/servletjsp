# Servlets

## Servlet API Overview

The Servlet API is a key component of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform, providing a framework for building web applications. It defines the classes and interfaces that developers use to write servlets, which are Java programs that extend the capabilities of a server. Servlets can respond to requests from web clients, typically browsers, and generate dynamic content.

## Key Components of the Servlet API

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Servlet Interface** | The Servlet interface is the central abstraction in the Servlet API. All servlets must implement this interface, either directly or, more commonly, by extending classes that implement it. |
| **HttpServlet Class** | The HttpServlet class is a convenience class that extends GenericServlet and implements the Servlet interface. It is designed to handle HTTP-specific services. |
