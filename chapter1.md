# Introduction

Servlet/JSP application architecture is a common approach for developing web applications in Java. This architecture leverages Java Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP) to build dynamic web content. Below is an overview of the key components and concepts involved in Servlet/JSP application architecture.

## Key Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Client (Browser)** | Users interact with the web application through a web browser. The browser sends HTTP requests and receives HTTP responses. |
| **Web Server** | The web server handles HTTP requests from clients and forwards them to the appropriate servlet or JSP for processing. Common web servers include Apache Tomcat, Jetty, and GlassFish. |
| **Servlets** | Servlets are Java classes that handle HTTP requests and generate responses. They are the backbone of the application, processing business logic, interacting with databases, and managing the application state. |
| **JSP (JavaServer Pages)** | JSPs are used to create dynamic web content. They are essentially HTML pages embedded with Java code, which can be executed on the server to generate dynamic content. |
| **Servlet Container** |  The servlet container (e.g., Tomcat) manages the lifecycle of servlets and JSPs. It handles the loading, instantiation, and execution of servlets and JSPs, and provides services like request dispatching and session management. |
| **Database** | The database stores the application's data. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is typically used to connect to and interact with the database from the servlet. |
| **Deployment Descriptor (web.xml) (optional)** | The web.xml file is used to configure the web application. It defines servlets, servlet mappings, initialization parameters, and other configuration settings. |

1. **Client Request**

   The client sends an HTTP request to the web server.

2. **Request Handling**

   The web server receives the request and forwards it to the servlet container.

3. **Servlet Processing**

   The servlet container matches the request URL to a servlet mapping defined in web.xml. The corresponding servlet processes the request, performs business logic, interacts with the database if needed, and generates a response.

4. **JSP Rendering**

   If the response involves generating dynamic HTML content, the servlet can forward the request to a JSP. The JSP generates the HTML content by executing embedded Java code and returning the result to the servlet.

5. **Response Generation**

   The servlet or JSP generates the HTTP response and sends it back to the web server.

6. **Client Response**

   The web server sends the HTTP response back to the client, which is rendered in the web browser.

Servlet/JSP application architecture provides a robust framework for building dynamic, scalable web applications in Java, leveraging the strengths of servlets and JSPs along with the MVC pattern to create maintainable and efficient applications.

## The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is an application layer protocol designed to transmit hypertext (structured text using logical links between nodes) and is used to retrieve interlinked resources from the web.

### Key Features of HTTP

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Stateless Protocol** | Each HTTP request is independent and has no memory of previous requests. This stateless nature simplifies the protocol but requires mechanisms like cookies and sessions to maintain stateful interactions. |
| **Request-Response Model** | HTTP operates on a request-response model, where a client (usually a web browser) sends an HTTP request to a server, and the server responds with the requested resource or an error message. |
| **Client-Server Architecture** | The client initiates the communication by making requests, and the server processes these requests and provides appropriate responses. |
| **Media Independence** | HTTP can transmit any type of data as long as both the client and server can handle the data format. Common data types include HTML, JSON, XML, images, and videos. |
