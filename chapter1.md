# Introduction

Servlet/JSP application architecture is a common approach for developing web applications in Java. This architecture leverages Java Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP) to build dynamic web content. Below is an overview of the key components and concepts involved in Servlet/JSP application architecture.

## Key Components

1. Client (Browser)

   Users interact with the web application through a web browser. The browser sends HTTP requests and receives HTTP responses.

3. Web Server

   The web server handles HTTP requests from clients and forwards them to the appropriate servlet or JSP for processing. Common web servers include Apache Tomcat, Jetty, and GlassFish.

5. Servlets

   Servlets are Java classes that handle HTTP requests and generate responses. They are the backbone of the application, processing business logic, interacting with databases, and managing the application state.

7. JSP (JavaServer Pages)

   JSPs are used to create dynamic web content. They are essentially HTML pages embedded with Java code, which can be executed on the server to generate dynamic content.

9. Servlet Container

   The servlet container (e.g., Tomcat) manages the lifecycle of servlets and JSPs. It handles the loading, instantiation, and execution of servlets and JSPs, and provides services like request dispatching and session management.

11. Database

    The database stores the application's data. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is typically used to connect to and interact with the database from the servlet.

13. Deployment Descriptor (web.xml) (optional)

    The web.xml file is used to configure the web application. It defines servlets, servlet mappings, initialization parameters, and other configuration settings.
