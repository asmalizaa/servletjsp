# Introduction

Servlet/JSP application architecture is a common approach for developing web applications in Java. This architecture leverages Java Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP) to build dynamic web content. Below is an overview of the key components and concepts involved in Servlet/JSP application architecture.

## Key Components

1. Client (Browser)

   Users interact with the web application through a web browser. The browser sends HTTP requests and receives HTTP responses.

3. Web Server

4. Servlets

5. JSP (JavaServer Pages)

6. Servlet Container
