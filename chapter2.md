# Servlets

## Servlet API Overview

The Servlet API is a key component of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform, providing a framework for building web applications. It defines the classes and interfaces that developers use to write servlets, which are Java programs that extend the capabilities of a server. Servlets can respond to requests from web clients, typically browsers, and generate dynamic content.

## Key Components of the Servlet API

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Servlet Interface** | The Servlet interface is the central abstraction in the Servlet API. All servlets must implement this interface, either directly or, more commonly, by extending classes that implement it. |
| **HttpServlet Class** | The HttpServlet class is a convenience class that extends GenericServlet and implements the Servlet interface. It is designed to handle HTTP-specific services. |
| **ServletRequest Interface** | The ServletRequest interface provides methods for accessing request information, such as parameters, attributes, and input streams. |
| **HttpServletRequest Interface** | Extends ServletRequest and provides additional methods for accessing HTTP-specific request information. |
| **HttpServletResponse Interface** | Extends ServletResponse and provides additional methods for generating HTTP-specific responses. |
| **ServletConfig Interface** | The ServletConfig interface provides servlet configuration information, such as initialization parameters and the servlet context. |
| **ServletContext Interface** | The ServletContext interface provides a way to interact with the servlet container. It allows servlets to access resources, share data, and log information. |

## Servlet

Servlet technology is used to create a web application (resides at server side and generates a dynamic web page).
Servlet technology is robust and scalable because of java language. Before Servlet, CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripting language was common as a server-side programming language. However, there were many disadvantages to this technology. We have discussed these disadvantages below.

There are many interfaces and classes in the Servlet API such as Servlet, GenericServlet, HttpServlet, ServletRequest, ServletResponse, etc.

Servlet can be described in many ways, depending on the context.

- Servlet is a technology which is used to create a web application.
- Servlet is an API that provides many interfaces and classes including documentation.
- Servlet is an interface that must be implemented for creating any Servlet.
- Servlet is a class that extends the capabilities of the servers and responds to the incoming requests. It can respond to any requests.
- Servlet is a web component that is deployed on the server to create a dynamic web page.
